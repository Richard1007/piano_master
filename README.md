## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Richard1007/piano_master.git
cd piano-ear-training
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
# cd ../backend && npm install
```

Start development servers:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
# cd backend && npm start
```

Visit the app at `http://localhost:5173`

## ðŸ”§ Firebase Integration

You may notice that we didnâ€™t install or start the backend server. Thatâ€™s because this app uses **Firebase Realtime Database** to manage the leaderboard, enabling real-time score updates without needing a custom backend.

To keep the project simple and easy to run or share:

- We use the **Firebase Client SDK** instead of the Admin SDK, avoiding the need to share sensitive credentials
- All database logic runs on the **client side**, within the browser
- Although a `backend/` folder exists, it's currently **not required**
- The Firebase setup is located at `frontend/src/utils/firebase.ts`
- Client-side code has permission to read and write leaderboard entries securely, enforced through **Firebase security rules**
