# Audio Files Setup

This directory should contain MP3 files for each piano note:

- C4.mp3
- C#4.mp3
- D4.mp3
- D#4.mp3
- E4.mp3
- F4.mp3
- F#4.mp3
- G4.mp3
- G#4.mp3
- A4.mp3
- A#4.mp3
- B4.mp3
- C5.mp3

## How to add real audio files:

1. Record or download piano note samples for each note (C4 through C5)
2. Name them exactly as shown above (e.g., "C4.mp3", "C#4.mp3", etc.)
3. Place them in this directory

## Alternative sources:
- Use a piano sample library
- Download from free music sample websites
- Record using a digital piano or keyboard

## Note about C#4, D#4, F#4, G#4, A#4:
These are the black keys on the piano. Make sure to include these files as well.

For now, the application will show console warnings when audio files are missing, but the piano keys will still be clickable for testing the interface.
